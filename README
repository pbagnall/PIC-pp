This program provides a command line interface to control KitsRUs DIY kits
149 and 150, allowing Microchip PIC microcontrollers to be programmed from the
Unix/Linux/Mac command line.

This project is fundamentally the work of Richard Altherr, whose original pp
program was released under the GPL v2 in 2005.  This version simply patches
bugs and updates the utility to support 18Fxxxx-series chips.  For more info-
rmation about the changes made, please see:

From the original README:

Notes for pp 0.1
----------------
* Limited testing has been performed with a Kit 150.  A Kit 149 should also
  work, but has not been attempted.
* This program was written mostly in the course of a single night.  It serves
  the needs of the developer currently, but many more features will be added
  in future releases.  Do not expect everything from this release.
* If you encouter a problem, try rebuilding with "CFLAGS=-DDEBUG".  This
  gives you a bunch of debug output including image dumps.  If you are
  reporting a bug, please include this output.
