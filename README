Notes for pp 0.1
----------------
* Limited testing has been performed with a Kit 150.  A Kit 149 should also
  work, but has not been attempted.
* This program was written mostly in the course of a single night.  It serves
  the needs of the developer currently, but many more features will be added
  in future releases.  Do not expect everything from this release.
* If you encouter a problem, try rebuilding with "CFLAGS=-DDEBUG".  This
  gives you a bunch of debug output including image dumps.  If you are
  reporting a bug, please include this output.
